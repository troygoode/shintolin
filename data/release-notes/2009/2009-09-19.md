The <b>IP limit</b> has been reinstated for version 2; as before, a maximum of 330 hits are permitted from one IP address per day. Note that only hits to the game.cgi script are counted. For example, buying skills or looking at profiles do not count towards your IP limit, but refreshing the page or chatting do.
