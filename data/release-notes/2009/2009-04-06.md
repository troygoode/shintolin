Shintolin astronomers are reporting that the pace of life has changed; the <b>years</b> now pass a rate of one every twelve real life days.

<b>Inactive players</b> now dissapear from the map after 5 days. Their accounts are not deleted and their characters reappear when they log back in.

In response to player feedback, players' actions are less limited when <b>dazed</b>; they can now search, give items, trade, and use non-revive items. To balance this, they now regain AP at a much slower rate until they are revived.

<b>New players</b> begin the game with three days' worth of food - however, they can only eat it while they remain at level one.
