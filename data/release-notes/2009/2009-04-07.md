A wandering tribe has settled by a large body of water, which they have named <b>Hermit Lake</b>. There seems to be a different distribution of <b>plant life</b> in that region; some items are more common, some are less so.

To allow villages more control over their resources, players that enter a square containing a <b>stockpile</b> can see all items that were added and removed within the past 24 hours. <b>Buildings</b> can now only hold a limited number of users.
