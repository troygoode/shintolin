<b>Farming</b> has been implemented. Iis has arrived at Eudaimonia's totem pole, bringing supplies of <b>wheat</b> to trade.

Crop cycles are effected by <b>seasons</b>, as are search rates and location descriptions. Currently, one season is equal to one real world day - this is temporary, to iron out any bugs in the system. It will increase to one season every three or four days at some stage.
